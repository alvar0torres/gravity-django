LIVE VERSION: https://gravityforce.herokuapp.com/

DESCRIPTION: web application created using JavaScript, Python, and SQL, based in part on the web track’s distribution code of the CS50 course.
The purpose of this web application is to allow users to convert a given weight from Earth into weight on other worlds of the Solar System, such as on the Moon or Mars.
For using the calculator it is necessary to register/login. When registering, the user's info is stored in a database.
Additionally, the application allows users to check the history of calculations, because they were stored in the database as well.
